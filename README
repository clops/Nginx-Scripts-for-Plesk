This is a set of scrips that has been initially published here:

http://www.grafxsoftware.com/faq.php/HOW-TO-configure-PLESK-with-NGinx-proxy-reverse/1/1/

I have taken the liberty to extend and adapt them to be used on Plesk 10.3+, I have
also modified the script NOT to overwrite existing nginx.conf files allowing
for hand-tuning of vhosts on demand.

Thanks for using these,
